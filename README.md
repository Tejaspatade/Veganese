# Veganese

This is a simple responsive website I created using HTML & CSS. I wanted to make a full-fledged website which had a modern look with best web development practices in mind. I followed along with Jonas Schmedtmann's course. Veganese is an imaginary startup which has subscription based model that delivers healthy vegan & vegitarian meals based upon it's user's preferences using AI.

I made use of several modern HTML tags with accessibility and SEO in mind. I used seantic tags like header, footer, nav, main, section to compartmentalize the webpage.

I used modern CSS technologies like CSS FlexBox and CSS Grid wherever possible to have an easy to build, yet highly responsive and adaptive layout. I used reusable classes with similar styles, Rubik font from Google Fonts, followed consistent font-sizes, font-weights, color schemes throughout the website.

This project was the first I made of it's size and thus might have some shortcomings. But I made this just as an exercise and wanted to fulle deply it as well. In further upcoming projects, I will aplly what i learned in this project and learn even more fun stuff.

Some Context For the Veganese Startup:
We are a technology company first, but with a major focus on consumer well-being through a healthy diet. Most people are very busy with their jobs, family and friends, and other important activities, which doesn't leave much time for cooking. This might lead to a poor diet and lasting health consequences. We want to solve this problem by using an AI-centric approach. Users can use our app to select their diet and foods they like and dislike, and our AI algorithm will create a custom and individual weekly meal plan. But we don't stop there. We partner with restaurants and other cooking partners to actually cook and deliver all meals from the generated meal plans, in selected cities. All this will be packed up in a monthly subscription, where users can choose between receiving one or two meals per day, every single day of the month.
