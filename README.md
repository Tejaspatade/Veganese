# Veganese

This is a simple responsive website I created using HTML & CSS. I wanted to make a full-fledged website which had a modern look with best web development practices in mind. I followed along with Jonas Schmedtmann's course. Veganese is an imaginary startup which has subscription based model that delivers healthy vegan & vegitarian meals based upon it's user's preferences using AI.

I made use of several modern HTML tags with accessibility and SEO in mind. I used seantic tags like header, footer, nav, main, section to compartmentalize the webpage.

I used modern CSS technologies like CSS FlexBox and CSS Grid wherever possible to have an easy to build, yet highly responsive and adaptive layout. I used reusable classes with similar styles, Rubik font from Google Fonts, followed consistent font-sizes, font-weights, color schemes throughout the website.

This project was the first I made of it's size and thus might have some shortcomings. But I made this just as an exercise and wanted to fulle deply it as well. In further upcoming projects, I will aplly what i learned in this project and learn even more fun stuff.
